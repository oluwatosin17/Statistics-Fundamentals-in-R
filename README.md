# Statistics-Fundamentals-in-R


We call properties with varying values **variables**. 
Variables in statistics can describe either **quantities** or **qualities**.


Generally, a variable that describes how much there is of something describes a quantity, and, for this reason, it's called a **quantitative variable**.

â€” a property that is not quantitative. Variables that describe qualities are called **qualitative variables** or **categorical variables.**
 Qualitative variables describe what or how something is.

For any variable measured on a **nominal scale:**

- We can tell whether two individuals are different or not (with respect to that variable).
- We can't say anything about the direction and the size of the difference.
- We know that it can only describe qualities.

Generally, for any variable measured on an **ordinal scale**, we can tell whether individuals are different or not. 
We can also tell the direction of the difference, but we still can't determine the size of the difference.

Variables measured on an ordinal scale can only be quantitative.
 Quantitative variables, however, can be measured on other scales. 

A variable measured on a scale that preserves the order between values and has well-defined intervals using real numbers is an example of a variable measured either on an interval scale, or on a ratio scale.

In practice, variables measured on interval or ratio scales are very common, if not the most common. Examples include:

- Height measured with a numerical unit of measurement (inches or centimeters).
- Weight measured with a numerical unit of measurement (multiples and submultiples of grams).
- Time measured with a numerical unit of measurement (multiples and submultiple of seconds).
- The price of various products measured with a numerical unit of measurement (dollars, pounds, etc.).


On a ratio scale, we can quantify the difference in two ways. One way is to measure a distance between any two points by simply subtracting one from another.
 The other way is to measure the difference in terms of ratios.

On an interval scale, however, 
we can measure meaningfully the difference between any 
two points only by finding the distance between them 
(by subtracting one point from another).

Generally, if there's no possible intermediate value between any two adjacent 
values of a variable, we call that variable **discrete**.


Common examples of discrete variables include counts of people in a class,
 a room, an office, a country, a house etc. For instance, if we counted the number of
 people living in each house of a given street, the results of our counting could only be integers. 
For any given house, we could count 1, 3, 7, 0 people, but we could not count 2.3 people, or 4.1378921521 people.


Generally, if there's an infinity of values between any two values of a variable, 
we call that variable **continuous**


Generally, every value of a continuous variable is an interval, no matter how precise the value is. The boundaries of an interval are sometimes called real limits.
 The lower boundary of the interval is called **lower real limit**, and the upper boundary is called **upper real limit.**


One way to simplify this dataset is to select a variable,
 count how many times each unique value occurs, and represent
 the **frequencies** (the number of times a unique value occurs) in a table. 



Because proportions and percentages are relative to the total number
 of instances in some set of data, they are called relative frequencies. 
In contrast, the frequencies we've been working with so far are called absolute frequencies because they 
are absolute counts and don't relate to the total number of instances.


**Generating a frequency distribution table for a column (col):**

`df %>%
  group_by(col) %>%
  summarize(Freq = n())`

**Sorting the values of frequency distribution table in ascending order (default):**

`df %>%
  group_by(col) %>%
  summarize(Freq = n())`

**Sorting in ascending order (being explicit):**

`df %>%
  group_by(col) %>%
  summarize(Freq = n()) %>% 
  arrange(col)`

**Sorting in descending order:**

`df %>%
  group_by(col) %>%
  summarize(Freq = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(col))`

**Finding proportions and percentages in a frequency distribution table:**

`df %>%
  group_by(col) %>%
  summarize(Freq = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Prop = Freq / nrow(df)) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Freq / nrow(df) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Freq))`

**Finding the percentile rank of a value (score) in a column:**

`mean(df$col <= value) * 100`

**Finding percentiles - only the quartiles:**

`quantile(df$col)`

**Finding any percentile we designate:**

`quantile(df$col, 
            probs = c(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0.75, 0.9, 1))`

**Generate percentiles for each value in a dataframe:**

`df %>% 
  mutate(cume_dist_col = cume_dist(col))`

**Generating a grouped frequency table:**

`df <- df %>% 
  mutate(categories = cut(col, breaks = 5, dig.lab = 4))
df %>% 
  group_by(categories) %>% 
  summarize(Freq = n())`

**Generating a grouped frequency table with custom class intervals:**

`df <- df %>% 
  mutate(categories = 
           cut(col, 
               breaks = c(0, 150, 300, 450, 
               600, 750, 900, 1050), 
               dig.lab = 4))`

**Showing frequency and percentage**

`df %>% 
  group_by(categories) %>% 
  summarize(Freq = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = Freq / nrow(df) * 100)`


A table that shows the frequency for each unique value in a distribution is called a frequency distribution table.

The frequencies can be expressed as:

- Absolute counts (absolute frequencies).
- Proportions or percentages (relative frequencies).

Quantiles provide us with the value of a random variable for a specified probability.

The three percentiles that divide the distribution in four equal parts are also known as quartiles. The lower quartile is the value of the quantile at probability 0.25.

The percentage of values that are equal or less than a value 
x is called the percentile rank of x
. For instance, if the percentile rank of a value of 32 is 57%, 57% of the values are equal to or less than 32.

If a value x has a percentile rank of p%
, we say that x is the pth percentile. For instance, if 32 has a percentile rank of 57%, we say that 32 is the 57th percentile.

Frequency distribution tables can be grouped in class intervals to form grouped frequency distribution tables. 
As a rule of thumb, 10 is a good number of class intervals to choose because it offers a good balance between information and comprehensibility.


In a skewed distribution:

- The values pile up toward the end or the starting point of the range, making up the body of the distribution.
- Then the values decrease in frequency toward the opposite end, forming the tail of the distribution.


If the tail points to the left, then the distribution is said to be left skewed. When it points to the left, the tail points at the same time in the direction of negative numbers, and for this reason the distribution is sometimes also called negatively skewed.

If the tail points to the right, then the distribution is right skewed. The distribution is sometimes also said to be positively skewed because the tail points in the direction of positive numbers.



If the shape of the histogram is symmetrical, then we say that we have a symmetrical distribution.

A very common symmetrical distribution is one where the values pile up in the middle and gradually decrease in frequency toward both ends of the histogram.
 This pattern is specific to what we call a normal distribution (also called Gaussian distribution).

Another common symmetrical distribution is one where the values are distributed uniformly across the entire range. This pattern is specific to a uniform distribution.


### Visualizing Frequency Distributions
**Vertical bar chart:**

`ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = col)) +
  geom_bar()`

**Horizontal bar chart**

`ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = col)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()`

**Proportions with bar charts**

`ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = col, 
             y = ..prop.., 
             group = 1)) +
  geom_bar()`

**Percentages with bar charts**

`ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = col, 
             y = ..prop.. * 100, 
             group = 1)) +
  geom_bar()`

**Horizontal stacked bar chart from summary table of proportions:**

`proportions <- df %>% 
  group_by(col) %>% 
  summarize(Prop = n() / nrow(df))
ggplot(data = proportions, 
              aes(x = "", y = Prop, fill = col)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.25) +
  coord_flip()`

**Simple pie chart for exploratory data analysis:**

`ggplot(data = proportions, 
              aes(x = "", y = Prop, fill = col)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")`

**Histogram - default number of bins (30):**

`ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = col)) +
  geom_histogram()`

**10 bins**

`ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = col)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)`

**Aligning 10 bins with range of values present for a single variable**

`custom_binwidth <- (max(df$col) - min(wdf$col)) / 10
ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = col)) +
  geom_histogram(boundary = min(df$col), 
                 binwidth = custom_binwidth)`


To visualize frequency distributions for nominal and ordinal variables, we can use:

- Bar chart.
- Pie charts.

To visualize frequency distributions for variables measured on an interval or ratio scale, we can use a histogram.
